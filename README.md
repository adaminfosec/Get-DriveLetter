# Get-DriveLetter
Get-DriveLetter parses only the \Dos\Devices\* in the MountedDevices registry located in the local machine registry hive. The returned information can be analyzed with [Get-USB](https://github.com/adaminfosec/Get-USB) to map the drive letter to the corresponding USB device found on a local Windows machine.
